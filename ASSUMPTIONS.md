# ASSUMPTIONS.md

This document lists the core assumptions that must be true for OpenSchool to succeed.

## Active Assumptions

### A1 — Daily Admin Stress is Painful Enough [HIGHEST RISK]

**Assumption:**
> School administrators struggle enough with daily tasks (attendance, grades, records) that they will actively seek and adopt a new solution.

**Why this must be true:**
If admin stress isn't painful enough, schools won't switch from their current process (spreadsheets, paper, existing systems).

**Current evidence:**
- Anecdotal from initial conversations
- Need structured interviews

**Confidence level:** Low

**Status:** Untested

---

### A2 — Schools Will Trust Cloud-Based Systems

**Assumption:**
> Schools in developing/semi-digital contexts will trust a cloud-based system with student data.

**Why this must be true:**
If trust is a blocker, adoption will fail regardless of features.

**Current evidence:**
- None

**Confidence level:** Low

**Status:** Untested

---

### A3 — Internet Connectivity is Sufficient

**Assumption:**
> Target schools have reliable enough internet access to use a web-based application daily.

**Why this must be true:**
If connectivity is poor, we may need offline-first architecture.

**Current evidence:**
- Assumption based on target market

**Confidence level:** Medium

**Status:** Untested

---

### A4 — Hierarchical Roles Match Reality

**Assumption:**
> The role hierarchy (org_admin > school_admin > staff > teacher > parent > student) matches how schools actually operate.

**Why this must be true:**
If roles don't match reality, the permission system will frustrate users.

**Current evidence:**
- Based on general education structure knowledge

**Confidence level:** Medium

**Status:** Untested

---

### A5 — Teachers Will Enter Grades Digitally

**Assumption:**
> Teachers will use the gradebook feature rather than keeping separate paper records.

**Why this must be true:**
If teachers don't enter grades, the system loses its core value.

**Current evidence:**
- None

**Confidence level:** Low

**Status:** Untested

## Review Rule

This file should be reviewed:
- Before building major features
- At the start of a new sprint
- After meaningful user feedback

If nothing changes here for weeks, you may be building on faith instead of evidence.
